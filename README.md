# python\_threshold\_overlays

A Python script for applying dynamic thresholding to images, with overlay visualization capabilities. Figure 6 in FLIM quality metric visualization as a means to validate consistency across large-area non-homogeneous FLIM datasets, Wilson et al.
Other scripts for image analysis and figure creation related to the paper are also in the flim-metrics repository with uw-loci

## Features

* Dynamic thresholding of images.
* Overlay visualization to highlight thresholded regions.
* Customizable parameters for thresholding operations.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* OpenCV (cv2)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hwilson23/python_threshold_overlays.git
   cd python_threshold_overlays
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the `threshold_dynamic.py` script with an image file:

```bash
python threshold_dynamic.py path_to_image.jpg
```

Adjust the thresholding parameters within the script as needed to suit your specific use case.
